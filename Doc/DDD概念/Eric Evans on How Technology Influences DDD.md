 								1*%* for a Better World 							

We care about the world in which we live and we want to make it a better place.

We are doing so by **fulfilling our mission to accelerate the human side of software development**.

We also **donate 1% of our profit to different causes**, which we as a company, as well as our employees, strongly believe in.
